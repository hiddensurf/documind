Text is legible in structured fonts (Arial-like) with high contrast (blue/yellowon white). No scaling issues in scanned image.  \n2. **Layout Efficiency** \u2013 Well-Organized. Central title, condensed notes, and schematics follow vertical hierarchy without clutter.  \n3. **Information Density** \u2013 Appropriate. Balances key details (project title, date) and references (technical diagrams) without excess.  \n4. **Practical Usability** \u2013 Good. Together, components clearly index technical content and provide rapid context for engineers.  \n\n**CRITICAL ISSUES**  \n- Missing 2D schematics scale reference in diagrams (location S-003, S-004).  \n- No explicit tolerance standards stated for mechanical/E structural sizes.  \n- Certification requirements (address device batch size variations) lack numerical Acceptance Criteria.  \n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS**  \n- Include ISO 2768-1 or ASME Y14.5 tolerance notes adjacent to mechanical/E system dimensions.  \n- Add conformity icons (e.g., CE, UL) to insulation system diagrams for quick verification.  \n- Expand notes\u2019 tables to specify allowable deviation ranges for given component geometries.\n\n\n---\nAnalysis completed in 5 stages. For follow-up questions, reference the above stages.\n",

It uses lines to show how the electricity and signals travel between all the important boxes and cameras so that people can watch the area and make announcements to keep everyone safe.\n\n---\n**Sources Used:**\n- \u2705 Initial 5-stage analysis (model: NVIDIA Nemotron Nano VL)\n- \u2705 Fresh vision examination (model: Google Studio gemini-2.5-flash)\n- \u2705 RAG synthesis with indexed documents\n",
